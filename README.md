# 🚀 AI Engineer Portfolio — Production AI Systems

Welcome to my AI Engineering portfolio.

Over 30 days, I built multiple end-to-end AI systems focusing on:

- Production APIs
- Vector search & embeddings
- RAG systems
- Fraud detection
- ML deployment
- Dockerized SaaS applications
- Automated testing & security

This repository demonstrates real-world AI engineering beyond notebooks.
